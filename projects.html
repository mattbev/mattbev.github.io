            <p class="lead">
                Much of my work in the domain of machine learning and computer vision has been targeted
                towards autonomous driving.

                        <h3>Multi Sensor Calibration</h3>
                        <p>
                            In order to safely navigate an environment autonomously, an agent will need to use an array
                            of sensors to perceive its surroundings. Each sensor's readings will need to be fused with
                            the others, and accurately knowing the relative pose of each is necessary to do so.
                            Critically, as agents move at higher speeds and sensors are placed farther apart the effects
                            of vibration and calibration misalignment become more pronounced &#8212; this is especially
                            true for 3D sensing systems such as stereo depth estimation. Our work produced the first
                            realtime per-frame autocalibration of sensor extrinsics, opening the door to a new class of
                            depth estimation that was previously not possible: wide-baseline stereo vision.

                        <p>
                            Depth estimation can be done using a variety of modalities, for example, through time of
                            flight sensing. In my work, I have focused on depth perception from camera images using both
                            monocular and stereo sensing. In the former I have explored ways to enforce temporally
                            consistent measurements, and in the latter our work has shown the ability to detect objects
                            the size of road debris at distances of hundreds of meters.

                Neural methods are still in the early stages of adoption for environmental modeling of Earth and other
                celestial bodies. They show great promise.

                    <p>
                        In this project, we propose a highly expressive spatiotemporal recurrent network architecture
                        fit to the task of forecasting Arctic sea ice concentrations. The resultant model structure
                        improves interpretability insights into which regions of the Arctic are most influential in
                        overall SIC compared to existing dynamical, statistical, and learned models, and can also be
                        supplied with mixed memory architectures to mitigate the gradient issues of existing recurrent
                        methods.
