                        <p>Blacktip Research is a joint venture that strives to increase financial clarity. It was born as a result of the following frustrations:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Directly accessing public company records is insanely slow</b>. To compare several companies across several years would require downloading a bunch of CSVs and manually parsing them.</li>
                            <li><b>Data aggregators that do the above for you are prohibitively expensive</b>. They range from several hundred dollars per year just for access to the data, up to tens of thousands for top of the line services like a Bloomberg terminal. The former only gives you the (publicly available through the SEC) data, and the latter has bells and whistles but is too expensive for the average joe.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>For these reasons, we've developed a Python library for public company fundamental analysis affectionately called <b>Angler</b>. Angler remains in early development, and in the near future we plan to expand its capabilities to include trading data and analysis. In the distant future, one of Blacktip's focuses is robo-advising.</p>
