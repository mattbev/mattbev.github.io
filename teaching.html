                    In the Fall of 2020 and Spring of 2021, I served as a Teaching Assistant
                    for MIT's graduate applied machine learning course.

                    Alongside <a class="intext-link" href="https://www.mit.edu/~idrori/">Prof. Iddo Drori</a>, the
                    Applied Machine Learning course is an offering for non-EECS graduate students at MIT Looking
                    to apply machine learning to their research or thesis. Students complete a semester-long project
                    in addition to introductory coursework and labs. Approximately 50 students were enrolled in both
                    semesters.

                    Along with my responsibilities for the graduate Applied Machine Learning course, I also was a member
                    of the teaching staff for the undergraduate course. For this, I ran labs, held office hours, and
                    helped design course materials. Approximately 500 students were enrolled.
