      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Computer Vision Engineer at <a href="https://nodarsensor.com" class="intext-link">NODAR</a> focused on
        untethered 3D perception and calibration for autonomy, using principles of signal processing and
        deep learning. I completed my Master of Engineering
        at the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/" class="intext-link">Massachusetts Institute of Technology
          (MIT)</a> where I concentrated in Artificial Intelligence
        while studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). I was advised by <a
          href="http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/" class="intext-link">
          Prof. Daniela Rus</a> of the <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/" class="intext-link">
          Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</a>
        where I researched computer vision, robotics, and machine learning. I also completed my Bachelor
        of Science at MIT in EECS and Mathematics,
        where I spent time working in CSAIL, the <a href="https://media.mit.edu/" class="intext-link">MIT Media Lab</a>,
        and outside of academia at
        places such as <a href="https://nasa.gov/" class="intext-link">NASA</a> and <a href="https://www.draper.com/"
          class="intext-link">
          Draper</a>. Additionally, I
        completed a minor in Theater Arts.
      </p>

      <p>
        My research focus has primarily been on deep learning and computer vision, with excursions into
        reinforcement
        learning. The impact areas I find most interesting are autonomous driving and planetary science. I served as a
        team lead for <a href="https://driverless.mit.edu" class="intext-link">MIT Driverless</a> and TA
        for MIT's graduate-level
        applied machine learning course (<a href="http://student.mit.edu/catalog/search.cgi?search=6.862"
          class="intext-link">6.862</a>)
        and undergraduate machine learning course (<a href="http://student.mit.edu/catalog/search.cgi?search=6.036"
          class="intext-link">6.036</a>).
        I was also involved in the organization of the <a
          href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/hacking-enable-transition-sustainable-energy-future-1211"
          class="intext-link">MIT EnergyHack</a>.
