                    <p>
                        I am a Computer Vision Engineer at <a href="https://nodarsensor.com"
                            class="intext-link">NODAR</a> solving untethered 3D perception
                        and calibration for autonomy, using principles of signal processing and
                        deep learning. I completed my Master of Engineering
                        at the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/" class="intext-link">Massachusetts Institute of Technology
                            (MIT)</a> where I concentrated in Artificial Intelligence
                        while studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). I was advised by <a
                            href="http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/" class="intext-link">
                            Prof. Daniela Rus</a> of the <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/" class="intext-link">
                            Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</a>
                        where I researched computer vision, robotics, and machine learning. I also completed my Bachelor
                        of Science at MIT in EECS and Mathematics,
                        where I spent time researching in CSAIL, the <a href="https://media.mit.edu/"
                            class="intext-link">MIT Media Lab</a>, and outside of academia at
                        places such as <a href="https://nasa.gov/" class="intext-link">NASA</a>. Additionally, I
                        completed a minor in Theater Arts.

                    <p>
                        My research focus has primarily been on deep learning and computer vision, with excursions into
                        reinforcement
                        learning. The impact areas I find most interesting are autonomous driving, climate, and
                        agriculture. I served as a
                        team lead for <a href="https://driverless.mit.edu" class="intext-link">MIT Driverless</a> and TA
                        for MIT's graduate-level
                        applied machine learning course (<a
