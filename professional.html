                    <p>I am an undergrad at the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> graduating in Spring 2020. I will receive a <i>B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</i> and a <i>B.S. in Math</i>, and I'll be pursuing a <i>MEng</i> in the former starting Fall 2020 at MIT. My academic focus has been machine learning, particularly the field of computer vision. The impact areas I find most interesting are agriculture, space exploration, and public policy. </p>

                    <P>Around campus I have been involved with the <a href="https://www.mitenergyhack.org/">EnergyHack</a> as a director, with a <a href="http://www.dke.mit.edu/">fraternity</a> as the treasurer, and briefly as an athlete on the <a href="https://www.mitathletics.com/sports/m-footbl/index">varsity football team</a>. Formerly, I was a tutor for several years through my <a href="https://education.fcps.org/ohs/home">high school's</a> tutoring center where I tutored students in all levels of math. While my academic focus is primarily in the sciences, I also enjoy music and theater. Thus, I am also pursuing a minor in Theater Arts. </P>

                    <p>My recent research in the <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a> has focused on new neural network layer types for computer vision. Earlier on in the lab, I also researched human decision making for use in artificial agents. Additionally, in the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT Media Lab</a>, I researched better vision methods for autonomous vehicles in inclement weather conditions. This upcoming summer, I will be researching <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/competency-aware-machine-learning">Competency-Aware Machine Learning</a> at <a href="https://www.draper.com/">Draper Laboratory</a> in Cambridge.</p>

                    <p>Professionally, I've held roles ranging from software developer to machine learning engineer at small <a href="https://nference.ai/">startups</a> to large <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">government agencies</a>. For the highlights, see my resume below!</p>
